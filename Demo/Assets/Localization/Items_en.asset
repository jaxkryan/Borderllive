    m_Localized: 'In 1601, in order to prepare for the process of expanding the borders
      of the realm and building Jiang Son Co Do, Lord Nguyen Hoang and his soldiers
      roamed along the banks of the Perfume River. He suddenly came across the image
      of a small hill rising by the blue river, like a dragon turning its head to
      look back. Legend has it that every night, an old woman in a red robe, with
      a happy face, goes up to Ha Khue hill and tells everyone: There will be a god
      here who will set up a pagoda to guard the dragon vein. Seeing that his idea
      had a connection with the story, Nguyen Hoang immediately had the soldiers
      build a pagoda on the hill.'

    m_Localized: At the end of the 16th century, Vietnamese people often placed Chu
      Dau pottery kilns as incense burners to offer in religious works. The engraving
      of the two words "Dai Tu" is the word Buddha, proving that the role of Buddhism
      in the Vietnamese mind is very important. After "thousands of years of Northern
      colonization", Vietnamese people still pose incense burners with the shape
      of Dong Son drums.
