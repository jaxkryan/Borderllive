    m_Localized: '(The girl smiles, her expression serene yet intriguingly mysterious.)

      At
      the beginning of the new year, people shake sticks to pray for good fortune
      and safety for a prosperous year ahead. But in the midst of this forest, meeting
      me is surely a great fate. I have two fortunes, each representing an ancient
      power that you can carry with you on your journey. Choose wisely, but be careful
      in your choice.

      Main gazes intently at the two fortune sticks before
      them, a sense of excitement welling up inside.'

      Thus, from
      now on, you have received the blessing from the sacred power of this forest.
      The path ahead is long, but remember, whether right or wrong, it all lies in
      fate. Go forth and carry this luck with you.'
